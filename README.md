**Hello, I'm a practitioner of technical world.**

It's not a title or anything, it's a simple way to express the immense joy I find in building things (or just being on the exciting journey of learning to build something new).

## Some cool things I've made

### Inspired by ideas ðŸ’¡

#### [Technical sharing hub system](https://github.com/huyhuynh12hhk/hhub-project)

It started with and idea about building simple community website for sharing new things, but after apply a few challenges, now this project build base on 5 different language within 6 frameworks (Gin, Spring, .NET Core, Django, Node Express and React). With CI/CD in place and a foundational test suite (though coverage is currently low). All these setup make the project work on proper, up-to-date development (in perfect condition due to some step missing).
Working with this project has offered me a wealth of fascinating experiences. I have to mirror myself to several part (almost 5) to learn and make decision when integrating new components.

And when new issues arrive too

Beside that, I've developed a "high availability" and "fault tolerant" mindset, not only in architecture anymore, it extends into the way I solve the problem. 
"High availability" where I have a large and flexible technical pool to use to tackle the problem within their combined communities and vast resources for reference. 
And fault tolerant mean when I encounter a roadblock with a new technology or a particularly complex framework (such as Spring problem), my skill set allows me to flexibly pivot to other tech stacks (.NET or Go), what I have more proficient than or which framework complexity is lower.



### Other practice projects âŒ›
Beyond the projects inspired by these ideas, I continuously refine my skills through these series projects where I implement fundamental programming concepts from scratch. These are currently available in the following languages:
- [Go](https://github.com/huyhuynh12hhk/go-scratch)
- [Java](https://github.com/huyhuynh12hhk/java-scratch)
